# ü¶Äü¶Ä Rusty Themy üé®üé®
*Obtain the current GTK color theme in Linux!*

</div>

```sh
$ cargo add rusty_themy
```
## Getting the current theme on Linux
It's easy! Just enable the `gtk` feature and use 
```rs
rusty_themy::gtk::current::current()
```
You can see the example here!
```sh
cargo run --example current_theme --features gtk
```
The output will be a JSON dump of the colors that I hope, get applied by GTK for its applications.
```rust
(
    {
        ...
        "dialog_bg_color": RGBA(
            RGBA {
                red: 247,
                green: 219,
                blue: 239,
                alpha: 255,
            },
        ),
        "light_4": RGBA(
            RGBA {
                red: 192,
                green: 191,
                blue: 188,
                alpha: 255,
            },
        ),
        "red_4": RGBA(
            RGBA {
                red: 192,
                green: 28,
                blue: 40,
                alpha: 255,
            },
        ),
        ...
    },
    [],
)
```
Custom colors that are defined by you will also be included! Not just the ones from GTK or Libadwaita.

Are you confused on what color to consume? Good place to start would be to visit the [Libadwaita docs on Named Colors](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/1.2/named-colors.html) or play with the [Gradience](https://github.com/GradienceTeam/Gradience) app!
